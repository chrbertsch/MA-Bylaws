# Procedure for bugfix / maintenance release of MA standards
The following procedure is recommended for the bugfix/maintenance releases of MA standards with no new features (typically "third digit" releases following semantic versioning):

MAP announces MA board and backoffice of planned maintenance release and availability document
Backoffice or MAP announces inspection period to MA members (min 4 weeks). During the this period, anyone can comment and the MAP can react. If there is no agreement between project and feedback provider, the MA board can decide if a "normal process" with full MA acceptance vote is necessary. 
In the last week of the four weeks inspection period, only editorial or typographic changes are allowed. Otherwise the inspection period gets prolonged accordingly.
If there are no blockers, the MAP can release the maintenance version of a standard
