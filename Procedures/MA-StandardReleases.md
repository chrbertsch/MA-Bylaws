# Procedure for bugfix / maintenance release of MA standards
The following procedure is recommended for the bugfix/maintenance releases of MA standards with no new features (typically "third digit" releases following semantic versioning):

The MAP announces to both the MA board and the backoffice the planned maintenance release and availability of relevant document(s).
The backoffice or the MAP announces the inspection period to the MA members (minimum of 4 weeks).
During this period, anyone can comment and the MAP shall react.
If there is no agreement between MAP and feedback provider, the MA board must decide if a "normal process" with full MA acceptance vote is necessary. 
In the last week of the inspection period, only editorial or typographic changes are allowed.
Otherwise the inspection period restarts.
If there are no blockers, the MAP may release the maintenance version of the MA standard.
