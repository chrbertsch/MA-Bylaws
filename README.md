# Modelica Association Bylaws #

This repository contains the Modelica Association Bylaws transformed from *doc* to [GFM (GitHub Flavoured Markdown)](https://github.github.com/gfm/) format. The goal is to maintain the bylaws in GFM format and export it to *docx* and *pdf* format if needed (can be performed with [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).).
