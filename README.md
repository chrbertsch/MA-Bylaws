# Modelica Association Bylaws #

This repository contains the Modelica Association Bylaws transformed from *doc* to [GFM (GitHub Flavoured Markdown)](https://github.github.com/gfm/) format. The goal is to maintain the bylaws in GFM format and export it to *docx* and *pdf* format if needed (can be performed with [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).).

At an extraordinary Modelica Association Assembly Meeting at end of Jan. or in Feb. 2020, the Pull requests for bylaw changes will be voted on. When an identical decision is made at least two months later at an Assembly Meeting, the bylaw changes will take effect immediately at this Assembly Meeting.
